# phasermmo
This project is the beginning of my Phaser MMO. I started this project by following Jerome Renaux's tutorial on how to utilize Node.js, socket.io and Phaser to create the initial game files. Renaux's guide detailed how the files work together to create the game object, server, and client. This is my first time using Express and Socket.IO and I have very little experience with Phaser. I found the tutorial from Renaux extremely valuable for this project as it helped bridge all of the modules and helped me understand how they work together.

To run this game, open the directory in terminal and run "npm install" , this should install all of the necessary modules to run the project. Once this is complete, using the command "node server" will run the node.js server and allow you to access the game via internet browser at "http://localhost:8080"

Once the game server is running and a player has been initilized into the game via browser, the character can move by mouse input. Currently the only functionlity in the game is movement but there is more to come.
